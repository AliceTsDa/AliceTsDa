<h1>
Hello there! Science X Art
</h1>


My name is Alice, I'm 22 and although I'm an art kid at heart, I also have a great passion for Science.
<br>
<br>
Most specifically I aspire to become a research scientist on the field of Bioinformatics.
<br>
Biomedical research fascinates me! I want to be able to help people through my science and that I think is a form of art on each own.
<br>
<br>
I'm also interested on ui/ux designing because it allows me to flex my creative muscles! In today's world everybody uses apps for all kind of purposes. We've all had a negative user experience, we've downloaded an app or entered a website and after five minutes we have a headache and we uninstall the app or quit the website. I want to change that!
<br>
<br>
For the record I speak Greek, English, Italian and French. I also have a classical harmony diploma and I'm working on getting my piano diploma. 
<br>
<br>
Wanna be singer and painter as well.
<br>
