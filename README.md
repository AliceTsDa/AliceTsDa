Science X Art
</h1>
My name is Alice, I'm 24 and although I'm an art kid at heart, I also have a great passion for Science!
<br>
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the NKUAðŸ’»
<br>
During my studies I've completed two internships. The first one on the field of Bioinformatics and the second one on Content Management Systems and Social Media Management.
<br>
I'm also interested on the field of ui/ux designing because it allows me to flex my creative musclesðŸŽ¨
<br>
Currently I'm working as Publishing Assistant on the children's book division at Patakis Publishers, getting to work on many creative projects that make the little bookworm kid I used to be very happyðŸ“–
<br>
I speak Greek, English, Italian and French. I also have a classical harmony diploma and I'm working on getting my piano diplomaðŸŽ¹
