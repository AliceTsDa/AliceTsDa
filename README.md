<h1>
Hello there! Science X Art
</h1>


My name is Alice, I'm 22 and although I'm an art kid at heart, I also have a great passion for Science.
<br>
<br>
Most specifically I aspire to become a research scientist on the field of Bioinformatics.
<br>
Biomedical research fascinates me! I want to be able to help people through my science and that I think is a form of art on each own.
<br>

For the record I speak Greek, English, Italian and French. I also have a piano and classical harmony diploma. Wanna be painter as well.
<br>

(My resume needs an update, I know :P)
