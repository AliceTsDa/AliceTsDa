Hello there! Science X Art
</h1>

My name is Alice, I'm 23 and although I'm an art kid at heart, I also have a great passion for Science!
<br>
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. 
<br>
During my studies I've completed two internships. The first one on the field of Bioinformatics and the second one on Content Management Systems and Social Media Management.
<br>
For my next job I'm looking for something on ui/ux designing because it allows me to flex my creative muscles! 
<br>
I speak Greek, English, Italian and French. I also have a classical harmony diploma and I'm working on getting my piano diploma.
